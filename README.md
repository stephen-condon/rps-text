### Rock-Paper-Scissors

This is a text-based implementation of the venerable rock-paper-scissors game in Go as a text game. Inspired by Raymond Camden's (@cfjedimaster) Code Break video [stream](https://cfe.dev/talkshows/codebreak-02202024/) from 2/20 , which showed a way to quickly hack together a text-based game in javascript. His is way prettier than using bash as the text screen.

Whoever stumbles on this, you can do much better!
